# defer.js

defer.js is a tiny jQuery-compatible Deferreds library.

## Why use defer.js?

- *It's small.* Minified and gzipped, it weighs less than 700 bytes. In contrast, [simply-deferred](https://github.com/sudhirj/simply-deferred) weighs ~1kb.
- *No BS.* Deprecated methods from jQuery are not included.
- *It works everywhere.* The default package includes support for AMD and node.js with no extra effort.
